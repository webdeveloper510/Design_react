  and fine sand.

  families with young children, and Aphrodite’s Beach is a great choice for
  swimming and sightseeing.

  smallText: Explore the Tombs of the Kings
  description1: To the west of the island, close to Paphos and surrounded by
    desert-like landscape, sit the Tombs of the Kings. This UNESCO World
    Heritage Site is an underground network of tunnels and chambers dating all
    the way back to 4th century BC. Exploring the Egyptian-inspired resting
    places will give you a real feel for ancient Cypriot history, and if you get
    there early you can avoid the afternoon hustle, bustle and heat.
  smallText1: Spend the day at Lara Beach
  description2: A short drive along a rocky road on the Akamas Peninsula will lead
    you to Lara Beach, a stretch of unspoilt coastline with a reputation for
    natural beauty. This is a quiet spot, but Lara Restaurant is on hand for
    beachside dining and drinks if you need a break from the sun. To preserve
    this piece of paradise, you won’t find sun loungers or parasols here –
    though you might spot some native sea turtles and monk seals if you’re
    lucky.

    Discover Emira Pottery
  description3: About a five-minute walk from Finikoudes Beach in Larnaca you will
    find a hidden gem called Emira Pottery. This shop sells stunning ceramics,
    including traditional cooking pots and decorative vases, and also offers a
    history of Cypriot pottery-making techniques. Whether you pick an
    artfully-made original piece or channel the film Ghost by creating your own
    vase, you’re bound to find the perfect souvenir here.
  smallText3: Take a tour of the Cyprus Wine Museum
  description4: Immerse yourself in the vineyards and exhibits at the Cyprus Wine
    Museum, and learn about the island’s colourful history of wine making. When
    the short tour is done, head downstairs to taste the fruits of the
    vineyard’s labours - you might even meet the friendly cat that’s made the
    winery his home.

  title: Whats the weather like in Cyprus?
  description1: Sun-soaked Cyprus offers an average 326 days of sunshine each
    year, making it a great choice for a brilliant beach break. Visit in July
    for average coastal temperatures where the thermometer rarely drops below
    27°C. Even if you choose to see the island in its low season – between
    November and February – the temperature tends to be a pleasantly mild 12°C
    on average.
